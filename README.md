# DigiWars.py-edition

This is a game made using python, which I made during my junior year of high school. This was also the first game I ever made.

This game has been inspired by many other games, and you might find the names of some of the 'cards' familiar!
I have enclosed two versions, do check out their rules in the beginning of the game(the rules are in the game itself) to see the difference.
